/**
 * We can use Divide and Conquer to find a peak in O(Logn) time. The idea is Binary Search based, we compare middle element with its neighbors.
 * If middle element is not smaller than any of its neighbors, then we return it. If the middle element is smaller than the its left neighbor,
 * then there is always a peak in left half (Why? take few examples).
 * If the middle element is smaller than the its right neighbor, then there is always a peak in right half (due to same reason as left half).
